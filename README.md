# eMesh

## A human-usable fast and universal GUI for Meshtastic nodes

### What is eMesh?

eMesh is an interface initially made for myself to be able to better control, understand and play with devices used in the [Meshtastic Project](https://meshtastic.org/). A brief and absolutely not definitive list of supported devices is provided in the next section.

### Compatible devices

Any device that is compatible with the current Meshtastic for Python version should be supported without any problems. However, is important to note that our tests have been made against the following devices:

â€¢ LilyGo LORA32
